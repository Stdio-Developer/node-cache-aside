# Simple and fast NodeJS internal caching with high performance.

A simple caching module that has `getOrSet` methods that allow you make a BE application with high performance
Keys can have a timeout (`ttl`) after which they expire and are deleted from the cache.


## HOW IT WORKS?

![How it works](./static/flow.jpg)


# Install

```bash
npm install node-cache-aside --save
```

# Examples:

## getOrSet:

```js
import { cacheAside } from "node-cache-aside"
const key = 'cacheKey'
const callback = async () => {
    const data = await getDataFromDB() // your function to get data from database
    return data
}
const TTL = 300 // seconds
const result = await cacheAside.getOrSet(key, callback, TTL)
```

### Function parameter

- `key`: *(type: string, require: true)* The cache key that you want to get or set the data in
- `callback`: *(type: async function, require: true)* The callback function to get the data if it doesn't exist on the cache
- `TTL`: *(type: number, require: false, default: null) The standard TTL as a number in seconds for every generated cache element. If it isn't specific, the cache will exist forever


## nodeCache
To use feature same as `node-cache` package, you can follow example below: 
```js
import { cacheAside } from "node-cache-aside"
const nodeCache = cacheAside.nodeCache()
const data = nodeCache.get('cache_key')
```
